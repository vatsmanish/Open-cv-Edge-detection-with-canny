# Open-cv-Edge-detection-with-canny

Use the OpenCV function Canny to implement the Canny Edge Detector.
Theory
The Canny Edge detector was developed by John F. Canny in 1986. Also known to many as the optimal detector, Canny algorithm aims to satisfy three main criteria:
Low error rate: Meaning a good detection of only existent edges.
Good localization: The distance between edge pixels detected and real edge pixels have to be minimized.
Minimal response: Only one detector response per edge
